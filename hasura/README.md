# Clowdr: Hasura

We use the Hasura GraphQL engine to power the interface between the frontend
and all of our backend services.

## Pre-requisites

1. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Setting Up

1. `cp hasura/.env.example hasura/.env.local`
1. If you are using an M1 Mac, note that Hasura's official Docker image does not yet support this platform. You will need to use a different image built by a third party. Swap `image: hasura/graphql-engine:v{version number}.cli-migrations-v2` for `image: fedormelexin/graphql-engine-arm64:v{version number}.cli-migrations-v2` in `docker-compose.yaml`, replacing the version number as appropriate.
1. Run the `Hasura Console -- Local Development` task within VSCode:
   `Terminal > Run Task`.
1. Check that the Docker Compose task ran successfully in the Task Output
   - If you get an error from this task, make sure the Docker app is running first!
1. Check that the Hasura Console task ran successfully in the Task Output
    - If you get an error message about `version check: failed to get
      version from server: failed making version api call...` try running
      the task again -- there is a race condition that can cause this.
1. Your browser should have opened a tab to the Hasura console

Now return to the main README.

## Local Development

See root ReadMe instructions for local development for which tasks to run.

**Note**: If the environment configuration for Hasura/Postgres or the Docker
Compose configuration change, then the Hasura local-dev tasks will need to
be restarted (which will also apply the changes to Docker).

## Remote Deployment

We use GitHub Actions (a.k.a. Workflows) to automatically deploy new versions
to Hasura Cloud and run migrations.
